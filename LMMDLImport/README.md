# LMMDLImport
A wrapper for KillzXGaming's MdlConverter because I want to save a few clicks.
## Requirements
* Wine (if on Linux)
* MdlConverter (duh!)
* Collada2GlTF (Blender doesn't support COLLADA anymore as of 5.0)
## Credits
* KillzXGaming for the actual logic which I just wrapped around because I don't really understand coding enough for reimplementing it.
